### How to add a new example?

1. Create a new folder into the `/data` directory. Name it from the global thing to the local thing. E.g., the first is a programming language, next a framework, and a bundler at the end (`typescript + react + webpack`). Use only the main things in the name, that show what this example is about. Avoid using all dependencies names in the folder's name.
1. Create all file structure you need. Include only needed dependencies. Exclude `node_modules` from there. If somebody download this example it must be runnable, so take care of this.
1. In each file divide important parts and secondary parts of code by comments and spaces.
1. That's all, you're the best! :)
